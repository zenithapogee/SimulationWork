CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finduuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins" with any of the following names:

    uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_pluginsConfig.cmake
    uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "uuv_world_plugins/uuv_world_plugins" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
